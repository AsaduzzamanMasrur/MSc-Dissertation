In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,
Alhamdulillah, I am grateful to have completed my MSc project, and I offer my sincerest thanks
to Allah (SWT) for His endless blessings and guidance.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Francis Babayemi for his steadfast support and invaluable
guidance during both this project and the entire course. As a course director, his unwavering
assistance has been instrumental in my journey. Without his help, completing this task would have
been immensely challenging.

I am deeply thankful to Enrico Grisan for his prompt and dedicated support in the initial phases
of my dissertation. His timely assistance ensured I received the right guidance, laying a strong
foundation for this project.

My profound appreciation goes to my dear family for their unwavering support and
understanding. Their sacrifices, encouragement, and unwavering presence during the highs and
lows have been the cornerstone of my perseverance. This project wouldn't have been possible
without their patience and love.
In the words of an old proverb, "It takes a village to raise a child." I am immensely grateful to
my 'village' for nurturing and supporting me throughout this endeavor. Their collective
contributions have been invaluable in bringing this project to fruition.
